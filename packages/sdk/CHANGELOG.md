# veto-sdk

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#62](https://github.com/VulnZap/veto/pull/62) [`188a543`](https://github.com/VulnZap/veto/commit/188a5431e293a6beada02d6dbcd029e87e0f5f12) Thanks [@yazcaleb](https://github.com/yazcaleb)! - Add client-side deterministic validation with cloud policy sync

  **Local deterministic validation** -- SDK now evaluates deterministic constraints locally before falling back to the server, eliminating network round-trips for simple checks (number ranges, string enums, regex patterns, required fields).

  **Policy cache with stale-while-revalidate** -- Policies fetched from the cloud are cached locally with configurable freshness and max-age windows. Stale policies serve immediately while a background refresh runs, ensuring zero-latency validation on cache hits.

  **Client-side decision logging** -- Validation decisions made locally are logged back to the server via fire-and-forget POST to `/v1/decisions`, keeping the dashboard audit trail complete without blocking the agent.

  **Python SDK parity** -- All features above are implemented identically in the Python SDK (`veto` on PyPI), including `PolicyCache` with background refresh, `VetoCloudClient.log_decision()`, and `VetoCloudClient.fetch_policy()`.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#53](https://github.com/VulnZap/veto/pull/53) [`7dc81c5`](https://github.com/VulnZap/veto/commit/7dc81c54aa544582ced4add8d651c2ffea3a16d3) Thanks [@yazcaleb](https://github.com/yazcaleb)! - Add require_approval flow with human-in-the-loop approval for tool calls

  **Cloud validation mode** -- New `cloud` validation mode routes tool calls through the Veto Cloud API for policy-managed validation. Supports `allow`, `deny`, and `require_approval` decisions.

  **Approval polling** -- When the cloud returns `require_approval`, the SDK automatically polls `GET /v1/approvals/:id` until a human approves or denies the call (or timeout). Configurable poll interval and timeout via config YAML or init options.

  **Approval preference cache** -- `setApprovalPreference(toolName, 'approve_all' | 'deny_all')` lets integrators cache a per-tool preference that skips server polling on subsequent calls. Clear with `clearApprovalPreferences()`.

  **onApprovalRequired hook** -- Fires when a tool call needs human review, enabling integrators (e.g. Sidekick) to present approve/deny UI. Receives full `ValidationContext` and `approvalId`.

  **VetoCloudClient** -- New standalone client with `validate()`, `pollApproval()`, `registerTools()`, retry logic, and typed `ApprovalTimeoutError`.

  **Python SDK parity** -- All features above are implemented identically in the Python SDK (`veto` on PyPI), including typed `ApprovalData`, `ApprovalPollOptions`, `ApprovalTimeoutError`, and the same hook/preference APIs.
